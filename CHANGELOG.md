## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 - Initial Release

This is the inaugural release of rust-utils, introducing a production-ready UID/GID remapping utility built with Rust's performance and safety guarantees.

**Key Highlights:**
- ðŸš€ **High Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions for maximum speed
- ðŸ”’ **Memory Safety**: No segfaults or buffer overflows
- ðŸ”§ **Cross-Platform**: Works on all Unix-like systems
- âš¡ **Extensible**: Clean architecture for adding new utilities
- ðŸ§ª **Well-Tested**: 43 comprehensive tests with >60% coverage
- ðŸ“š **Documented**: Professional documentation and examples

**Perfect for:**
- System administrators managing container migrations
- DevOps engineers handling user namespace configurations
- Developers needing reliable filesystem ownership tools
- Anyone seeking memory-safe alternatives to traditional Unix tools

**Getting Started:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dgalbraith/rust-utils.git
cd rust-utils && cargo install --path .
rust-utils remap /path/to/directory --from-base 100000 --to-base 50000000 --dry-run
```
